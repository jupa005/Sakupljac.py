My first python game!
GOAL: Make the biggest score as you can.
Each time you eat a food, you get a +3 seconds on your timer.
If timer gets to the 0, the game is over.
I will try to make a better timer in future (I've had some problems with timer sleep and key binding) :)
If you want to make the game more difficult:
  1) Change the timer to the lower number at the start
  2) Change the amount of the seconds that adds to the timer (while True loop -> if is_collision(igrac,hrana) -> timer += YOUR NUMBER)
ENJOY :)
